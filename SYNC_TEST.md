# Sync Test

This file is created to trigger a full GitHub sync of all project files.

## Current Project Structure:
- src/ folder with React components
- index.html (main entry point)
- package.json with dependencies
- All configuration files
- Assets and images

If you see this file in your GitHub repo, but still don't see the src/ folder and index.html, then Bolt's GitHub sync has limitations and we'll need to use manual upload.
